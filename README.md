# dispatch-tech-web

The Web based Admin component of an ticket management system

  * To use you will need your own MongoDB url or some reconfiguring to use a different db 
  * A google places API key will also be needed
  * I would store these in a default.json file inside the empty config folder in the root of the project

To get started clone project into a new directory
  yarn install &&  yarn client-install
  
  yarn dev //runs concurrently to start server and client react app simultaneously
